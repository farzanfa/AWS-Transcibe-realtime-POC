# Medical WebSocket Connection Fix

## Issue
The medical transcription WebSocket endpoint was experiencing a `concurrent.futures._base.InvalidStateError` when closing connections. This error occurred in the AWS CRT HTTP library when it tried to set a result on a future that had already been cancelled.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by improper cleanup order during WebSocket disconnection:
1. The handler task was being cancelled while the AWS Transcribe stream was still active
2. The AWS CRT library continued trying to process incoming data and set results on futures
3. These futures had already been cancelled, causing the InvalidStateError

## Solution
The fix implements proper cleanup sequencing in `medical_streaming.py`:

1. **Graceful stream closure**: The audio writer task now properly ends the stream before termination
2. **Ordered task cancellation**: Tasks are cancelled in the correct order:
   - First, stop accepting new audio by setting `running = False`
   - Send a sentinel value to the audio queue to signal completion
   - Wait for the write task to complete (which ends the stream)
   - Add a brief delay to allow remaining events to be processed
   - Finally, cancel the handler task
3. **Better error handling**: Added checks for "closed" and "cancelled" errors to avoid logging expected errors
4. **Cancellation awareness**: Tasks now properly handle `asyncio.CancelledError`

## Testing
To test the fix, use the provided test script:

```bash
# Ensure the server is running
docker-compose up

# In another terminal, run the test
python test_medical_websocket.py
```

The test script performs multiple rapid connect/disconnect cycles to ensure the connection cleanup is stable.

## Code Changes

### medical_streaming.py
- Modified `stop_transcription()` method to implement proper cleanup sequence
- Enhanced `_write_audio_chunks()` with better cancellation handling
- Added debug logging for better troubleshooting

## Impact
This fix ensures that medical WebSocket connections can be closed cleanly without errors, improving the reliability of the real-time transcription service.
