# AWS Transcribe Medical Real-time Streaming Implementation

## Current State of AWS Transcribe Medical Streaming

As of the latest updates, there are some important considerations regarding AWS Transcribe Medical real-time streaming:

### 1. SDK Support Limitations

The standard `boto3` SDK does **not** include a `transcribestreaming` client. Real-time streaming requires specialized SDKs:

- **amazon-transcribe SDK**: This is the official Python SDK for streaming transcription
- **Direct API calls**: You can also use HTTP/2 or WebSocket protocols directly

### 2. Medical Streaming Availability

AWS Transcribe Medical supports real-time streaming through the `StartMedicalStreamTranscription` API. However, the implementation varies:

- **Direct API**: The `StartMedicalStreamTranscription` API is available via HTTP/2 and WebSocket
- **SDK Support**: The `amazon-transcribe` SDK may not have direct `start_medical_stream_transcription` method in all versions

### 3. Implementation Approach

Our current implementation (`medical_streaming.py`) takes a hybrid approach:

1. **Primary Method**: Attempts to use `start_medical_stream_transcription` if available in the SDK
2. **Fallback Method**: Uses regular `start_stream_transcription` with medical vocabulary support

```python
try:
    # Try medical-specific method
    stream = await client.start_medical_stream_transcription(
        specialty='PRIMARYCARE',
        type='CONVERSATION',
        # ... other medical parameters
    )
except AttributeError:
    # Fall back to regular streaming with medical vocabulary
    stream = await client.start_stream_transcription(
        vocabulary_name='medical-vocabulary',
        # ... standard parameters
    )
```

### 4. Medical Features Supported

The implementation supports all key medical transcription features:

- **Medical Specialties**: PRIMARYCARE, CARDIOLOGY, NEUROLOGY, ONCOLOGY, RADIOLOGY, UROLOGY
- **Transcription Types**: CONVERSATION, DICTATION
- **Content Identification**: PHI (Protected Health Information)
- **Speaker Identification**: Optional speaker labels
- **Medical Vocabulary**: Custom medical vocabulary support
- **Entity Detection**: Medical entity recognition (when available)

### 5. Alternative Approaches

If you need guaranteed medical streaming support, consider these alternatives:

#### Option 1: Direct WebSocket API
```python
# Use boto3 to create pre-signed URL
# Connect via WebSocket directly
# Send audio frames following AWS protocol
```

#### Option 2: AWS HealthScribe
AWS HealthScribe is a newer service that combines transcription with clinical documentation:
- Real-time streaming support
- Built-in medical understanding
- Clinical note generation
- HIPAA eligible

#### Option 3: HTTP/2 Streaming
Use the HTTP/2 protocol directly with the StartMedicalStreamTranscription endpoint.

### 6. Environment Variables

Configure the service with these environment variables:

```bash
# Basic Configuration
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret

# Medical Configuration
MEDICAL_SPECIALTY=PRIMARYCARE
MEDICAL_TYPE=CONVERSATION
MEDICAL_VOCABULARY_NAME=your-medical-vocab
MEDICAL_CONTENT_IDENTIFICATION_TYPE=PHI
SHOW_SPEAKER_LABELS=true
```

### 7. Testing the Implementation

To test if medical streaming is working:

1. Check the logs for "Started medical stream transcription"
2. Verify medical entities are being detected in the transcripts
3. Confirm the specialty and type are being applied

### 8. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **"Unknown service: 'transcribestreaming'"**: This is expected with boto3. Use amazon-transcribe SDK.
2. **"No attribute 'start_medical_stream_transcription'"**: The SDK version may not support it. The fallback will be used.
3. **Region issues**: Ensure AWS Transcribe Medical is available in your region.

### 9. Recommended Production Setup

For production use:

1. Use direct WebSocket or HTTP/2 connections for guaranteed medical streaming
2. Implement retry logic and connection management
3. Store transcripts with proper PHI handling
4. Consider AWS HealthScribe for comprehensive medical documentation
5. Implement proper authentication and authorization

### 10. Compliance Considerations

When using AWS Transcribe Medical:

- Ensure HIPAA compliance in your infrastructure
- Use encryption in transit and at rest
- Implement proper access controls
- Audit all transcript access
- Follow PHI handling best practices

## Next Steps

If you need guaranteed medical streaming support:

1. Implement direct WebSocket connection to StartMedicalStreamTranscription
2. Consider migrating to AWS HealthScribe
3. Contact AWS support for guidance on your specific use case

The current implementation provides a robust foundation that will work with standard transcription and can leverage medical features when available.
